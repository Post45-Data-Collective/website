# Post45 Data Collective Website

https://data.post45.org/

This is the website for the Post45 Data Collective, which uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the [R DT library](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and the [JavaScript Tabulator library](https://tabulator.info/).

Benefits of Quarto include: publication-quality, citeable articles and references that can be recognized by Google Scholar; easy integration with code such as data tables; articles that are created with Markdown, which can ease the publication pipeline by preserving formatting and links from submitted Word Documents and Google Docs; entirely free and open-source tools.
