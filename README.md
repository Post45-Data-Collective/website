# Post45 Data Collective Website

https://post45-data-collective.github.io/website/

This is a draft Quarto website for the Post45 Data Collective, which uses the [R DT library](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) and the [JavaScript Tabulator library](https://tabulator.info/) to create data tables.

Benefits of Quarto include: publication-quality, citeable articles and references that can be recognized by Google Scholar; easy integration with code such as data tables; articles that are created with Markdown, which can ease the publication pipeline by preserving formatting and links from submitted Word Documents and Google Docs; entirely free and open-source tools.
