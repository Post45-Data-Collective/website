Then, duplicate this template, rename it index.qmd, and place it inside the appropriate directory inside /posts.

Then fill in the rest of the information above and below. -->

<!-- Include brief introduction to/description of data essay  -->

The Index of Major Literary Prizes in the US includes two related datasets:  

1.  The first is a dataset of the winners and judges of prizes for prose, poetry, or unspecified genre between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of \$10,000 and over.
2.  The second contains records for volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library written by authors who won a prize in the prize winners dataset.

<!-- If there are multiple datasets, please provide a title for each dataset with its own description  -->

<!-- # 1. Title of dataset 1

This dataset includes information about the winners and judges of literary prizes (for prose, poetry, or unspecified genres) between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of \$10,000 and over. The dataset includes details about the winners of 52 unique prizes awarded by 22 institutions. For a subset of 39 prizes, it includes details about judges; not every prize has complete judge data. The dataset does not include prizes awarded specifically for children’s literature, nonfiction, drama, or translation. -->

# Data Table
