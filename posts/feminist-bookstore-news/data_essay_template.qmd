<!-- EDITORIAL TEAM: Create a new directory in posts/ with appropriate title for data essay (which will become the URL slug, e.g. /nea-creative-writing-fellowships becomes https://post45-data-collective.github.io/website/posts/nea-creative-writing-fellowships/).

Then, duplicate this template, rename it index.qmd, and place it inside the appropriate directory inside /posts.

Then fill in the rest of the information above and below. -->


 <!-- Include image for data essay -->

<!-- Include brief introduction to/description of data essay  -->

The Index of Major Literary Prizes in the US includes two related datasets:  

1.  The first is a dataset of the winners and judges of prizes for prose, poetry, or unspecified genre between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of \$10,000 and over.
2.  The second contains records for volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library written by authors who won a prize in the prize winners dataset.

<!-- If there are multiple datasets, please provide a title for each dataset with its own description  -->

<!-- # 1. Title of dataset 1

This dataset includes information about the winners and judges of literary prizes (for prose, poetry, or unspecified genres) between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of \$10,000 and over. The dataset includes details about the winners of 52 unique prizes awarded by 22 institutions. For a subset of 39 prizes, it includes details about judges; not every prize has complete judge data. The dataset does not include prizes awarded specifically for children’s literature, nonfiction, drama, or translation. -->

# Data Table

<!-- FOR EDITORIAL TEAM:

To create a data table, first add the dataset to the datasets/ directory in the GitHub repo. 

Then, find the raw GitHub URL for that dataset and insert it below, customizing columns as needed.

Areas that need to be edited are marked with MAKE EDITS HERE -->
