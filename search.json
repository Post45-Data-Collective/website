    "section": "",
    "text": "In summer of 2021, the Post45 Data Collective awarded its inaugural round of Data Development Grants. These grants were designed to help researchers in the late stages of data collection — where projects have a tendency to stall — complete their data curation and cleaning, and prepare their data for publication with the Data Collective.\nWe were fortunate to have an excellent partner supporting these efforts. In collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Graduate Global Impact Program, we worked with Jordan Pruett, a doctoral candidate in English, to provide DDP Grant Recipients with up to 60 hours of research assistance each. Jordan offered his expertise as a student of computational text analysis and post-45 American literature, providing considerable support and insight.\nIn sum, we supported the work of four excellent projects addressing a range of subjects, from the Literature Program of the NEA to a corpus of Film Scripts. Together, these projects represent the exciting possibilities for computational approaches to post-45 US literature and culture.\n—\nThe Wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan in US Fiction, 1965-2020\nDavid F. Eisler\nThis dataset collects titles of American novels and short story collections published between 1965 and 2020 about the conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, bringing together multiple bibliographic resources to build a comprehensive picture of more than half a century of the US war fiction genre. We began by merging and cleaning two established sources on the works about the Vietnam War, John Newman’s Vietnam War Literature: An Annotated Bibliography of Imaginative Works about Americans Fighting in Vietnam and La Salle University’s special archival collection, “Imaginative Representations of the Vietnam War.” We then used the WorldCat database to extract a set of imaginative works about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were combined with the Vietnam data to form the final dataset. We will complete the dataset by adding ethnographic data about the author’s gender and whether they were a military veteran.\nNew York Times Nonfiction Bestsellers by Black Authors\nAriel Lawrence\nTo examine the prevalence, profitability, and popularity of nonfiction texts written by Black authors, we collected weekly bestseller lists published by the New York Times from 2010 to 2020. We researched each author and located those who either self-identified as Black or of African descent or were identified by reputable sources as such. Out of 1657 titles, we located 117 identified as by at least one Black author, a rate of about 7%. In addition to title and author, this dataset includes categories for genre (essays, celebrity or general memoir, anti racist pedagogy, manifesto, social analysis, etc.), author occupation, publisher, year published, book description, top rank, and number of weeks each book remained on the list. With this dataset, we aim to better understand the past and future of Black nonfiction.\nThe Black List Film Script Corpus\nJohnny Ma\nThe Black List Film Script Corpus (TBL Corpus) is a collection of ~1,000 movie scripts that were featured on The Black List. Founded in 2006, The Black List is an annual collection of promising screenplays compiled from the votes of hundreds of film executives. Our TBL Corpus contains nearly all TBL scripts in .txt format, with line indenting parsed from the original PDF submission. We include author and script metadata where available.\nThis corpus builds upon other screenplay corpora, such as ScriptBase, that aim to understand the creative output of screenwriters. The TBL Corpus differs from previous such datasets as it contains unproduced screenplays, giving us an exclusive look into screenplays at the pre-greenlight stage of film production. The corpus also comes from scripts written in 2006-2020, making it the most current dataset of movie scripts available. We plan to update the dataset with each annual iteration of The Black List. \nThe Literature Program of the National Endowment for the Arts\nAlexander Manshel\nThis project will create a comprehensive database of the writers funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), under the auspices of the NEA’s literature fellowship program. Since its inception in 1965, the NEA has funded more than 3600 poets and fiction writers. Over that half century, the Endowment’s selection process and funding priorities have shifted repeatedly in response to government oversight, the composition of its advisory boards, and evolving notions of literary prestige. This database will allow scholars and students to investigate how these changes have influenced which writers are sponsored by the NEA. In its first iteration, the database will include essential information about each writer, including year of funding, demographic data, and information on their undergraduate and graduate education. As the project develops, it may also include information about the specific literary works funded by NEA grants. In all, this project aims to provide a useful resource for scholars of twentieth- and twenty-first-century American literature, multi-ethnic American literature, and literary sociology."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nThe data about prizes and winner/judge demographics was collected by hand mainly from institutional websites. Gender and higher education data for individuals was collected from author biographies, interviews, and other materials.  Some information about judges not listed on websites was obtained through correspondence with institutions. Claire Grossman, Juliana Spahr, and Stephanie Young are the principal investigators, did the majority of the data gathering, and are responsible for any errors. They were assisted by Jennifer Chukwu, Clare Lilliston, Jordan Pruett, Esther Vinarov, and Betty He. Richard Jean So provided significant support for this project.\nGender information was provisionally labeled by the research team based on pronouns used by author in biographical notes at the time research was completed. It is possible a judge/winner’s gender identity and/or pronoun may have changed subsequently. This information is intended to enable study of broad patterns over time and not as definitive statements on any individual identity. The possible gender values are “male,” “female,” “nonbinary/he,” “nonbinary/they,” “unknown,” and “No Winner”; nonbinary was used only when the term appeared in the individuals’ biography.\nHigher education information was labelled by the research team based on whether the individual mentioned that they attended (even if they did not graduate from) an institution. Again, this information is intended to enable the study of broad patterns over time and is not meant to be definitive. The possible MFA degree values are the name of institution, “No Winner,” or blank (in most cases, a blank means it is unlikely that the individual attended an MFA program, because higher education affiliations were listed in biographical notes but did not include an MFA, or because the team was unable to locate any educational information about the individual).\nThe possible “elite education” values are “Barnard College,” “Brown University,” “Columbia University,” “Cornell University,” “Dartmouth College,” “Harvard University,” “Princeton University,” “Radcliffe College,” “Stanford University,” “University of Pennsylvania,” “University of Chicago,” “Yale University,” “No Winner,” or blank. The possible “graduate degree” values (including masters, PhD, JD, and medical degrees) are “graduate,” “No Winner,” or blank.\nAt a later stage, persistent identifiers for winners and judges, such as VIAF, LCCN, and Wikidata identifiers, were added by Matt Miller computationally.\nPlease report any errors and/or corrections via this Google Form."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nThis data was assembled by Jordan Pruett. Matches between prize-winning authors and authors in the HathiTrust Digital Library were produced by performing an exact string comparison between the last_name and given_name columns of the prize dataset to the author column of the HathiTrust dataset held by the Post45 Data Collective. Fields were forced to lowercase and stripped of punctuation and spacing before comparison. This conservative matching process is likely to produce two kinds of errors: missed matches, in the case of authors who appear under different names in the two spreadsheets; and false positive matches, in the rare case of two authors with identical first and last names. The first type of error was considered acceptable: the data aims to maximize true positive matches rather than minimize false negatives. Since matches were assessed restrictively, researchers can be confident that the vast majority of the entries in this dataset were in fact authored by somebody who also appears in the prize dataset. In order to estimate the rate of the second, more problematic type of error, a random sample of 100 entries was taken from the final dataset and checked manually for accuracy. This sample contained no errors, though it did contain one match that could not be verified, since no secondary literature could be located for the author in question.\nFinally, it is worth noting that hathitrust_prizewinners.csv does not distinguish between the types of prizes won by authors nor the point in their careers that those authors won those prizes. For each author in the prize dataset, it simply lists every HathiTrust volume authored by that author that could be located.\nAt a later stage, persistent identifiers for authors, such as VIAF, LCCN, and Wikidata identifiers, were added by Matt Miller computationally. He also added book information from OCLC—a global library organization that contains information from more than 16,000 member libraries in more than 100 countries—such as how many copies of each edition are held by these libraries (oclc_holdings or oclc_eholdings). This information was accessed through the OCLC Classify API, which was shut down in January 2024."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nIn addition to the biographical and institutional data described above, we have provided a collection of metadata and publication data connected to a corpus of volumes written by authors affiliated with the IWW. This corpus, provided by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), is comprised of 1228 volumes with 240 unique individuals listed as main authors. Because we knew it would be impossible to assemble a comprehensive corpus of every author in our institutional dataset and because we knew that many authors who attended the IWW never published work, when building our corpus in collaboration with HTRC we used two selection criteria. First, we searched HTRC’s collections for works by any author listed as director of a IWW graduate’s thesis. Secondly, given that we intend our database to drive a public-facing web service, we searched for authors from Wikipedia’s “List of Iowa Writers’ Workshop people,” as this list constituted an example of an externally and publicly defined list of notable IWW authors. We also felt these criteria would maximize our success rate at finding published works for our author list.\nThe volume publication data and metadata provided follow the model established by Ted Underwood’s dataset submitted to the Post45 Collective. Along with author and title information, we have listed each volume’s publisher as well as publication date and location (from MARC metadata). We have also provided Library of Congress and OCLC catalog information for the volumes."

    "text": "The Post45 Data Collective is a peer-reviewed, open-access repository for literary and cultural data from 1945 to the present.\nPeer Review & Citation\nWe encourage scholars to share their data openly by providing a formal peer review process for datasets and by publishing datasets with citable DOIs that are registered with the Library of Congress. These conventions enable scholars to earn much-deserved recognition for their intellectual labor, since peer-reviewed publications and citations are considered among the highest forms of scholarly achievement.\nExploration & Usability\nWe further enable the scholarly community and general public to explore and re-use our datasets by hosting them on an easily navigable website that allows for simple searching, filtering, and downloading.\nDocumentation & Data Essays\nLastly, we provide robust documentation for all our datasets by requiring authors to submit “data essays,” which address the social and historical context of the data, how the data was collected, clean, and categorized, as well as possible ethical concerns or misuses of the data.\n\nSupport\nThe Post45 Data Collective has received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (2024-2026) and Emory’s Program to Enhance Research and Scholarship (PERS) (2023).\n\n\nHistory of the Project\nDan Sinykin and Laura B. McGrath began planning and research for the Post45 Data Collective in 2019. They observed that many scholars in the field of post-1945 literature and culture were building datasets and collaborating informally to figure out how to make various interpretive and technical decisions related to the data. Data is particularly important to the period of literary and cultural history after 1945 because of the exponential growth in the number of books and cultural objects produced, which makes understanding broad trends in the field difficult without the help of data.\nWhile the scholar-driven curation of datasets in the 2010s was thus very valuable, scholars’ formatting and documentation choices were happening on a piecemeal basis; they were not receiving academic recognition for their labor; and their finished datasets did not have a suitable home.\nTo address these problems, Sinykin and McGrath decided to launch a field-specific, open-access, peer-reviewed data collective. To do so, they performed a literature review, assembled an editorial board (consisting of scholars in literary studies, digital humanities, and library and information science), developed peer review criteria, and established coordination with the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, which agreed to build a website and maintain its data infrastructure. On March 1, 2021, Sinykin and McGrath launched the Post45 Data Collective.\nIn the summer of 2021, we launched the “Data Development Project” (DDP), a program designed to help researchers in the field complete the final stages of data collection work by providing them with up to 60 hours of data curation-focused research assistance. Through this assistance (awarded via mini-grants), we supported the work of four excellent datasets, which address subjects ranging from the literature program of the NEA to Hollywood film screenplays, and which will eventually be published in the collective.\n\n\nPublic Writing & Media\nIn October 2022 and November 2023, the Post45 Data Collective partnered with Public Books to publish two series of essays, “Hacking the Culture Industries,” which both drew on and was inspired by data from the collection.\nPost45 Data Collective datasets have also been featured prominently in venues including the Los Angeles Review of Books, Poets & Writers Magazine, and WNYC’s On the Media."

    "text": "A Note on Sensitive Information\nAll of the information in this dataset is publicly available. Nevertheless, information about any individual writer’s year of birth, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or education is sensitive. This data is provided here only to enable the study of broad patterns throughout the history of the NEA Creative Writing Fellowships and not intended as definitive. Requests to correct, amend, or remove any such sensitive information will be honored. Please contact Alexander Manshel (alexander.manshel@mcgill.ca) with any questions or concerns.\nMore than 240 NEA fellowships have been awarded to writers who have publicly identified themselves as “white” or “a white writer,” and are listed here as such. That said, nearly 2900 fellowships (over 78 percent of all fellowships in the dataset) are listed as “uniden,” or unidentifying, in the field corresponding to race and ethnicity. Many of these writers likely identified or identify as white, but the research team was nevertheless unable to find a source to corroborate that active identification. This is unsurprising given how whiteness often goes unmarked. As Morrison (1993) writes in Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992) about one of Ernest Hemingway’s characters, “we know [he] is white, and we know he is because nobody says so.” Despite this, writers in this dataset are listed alternatively as “white” or “uniden” in order to avoid presuming or projecting whiteness onto individual writers. Given that many writers refer to themselves as “Irish American” or “German American,” for example, without explicitly identifying as white, the dataset lists them here as “uniden / irisham” or “uniden / germanam.”\nThe 94 unique values for the field of “race_ethnicity” include: “afam” (African American); “arabam” (Arab American); “asianam” (Asian American); “black / caribam” (Black or Caribbean American); “indigenous,” “latinx,” “mixedrace,” “uniden,” “uniden / jewish,” “white,” “white / jewish.” In the case that writers identify in multiple ways, those multiple identifications are listed here separated by slashes: e.g., “asianam / southasian,” “indigenous / latinx,” “uniden / germanam / jewish.”\n\n\nMorrison, Toni. 1993.

    "section": "Significance and Context",
    "text": "Significance and Context\nNordic Noir – crime fiction originating in the Nordic region – is one of the most significant international publishing success stories of the twenty-first century. It is often associated with Stieg Larsson’s posthumously published Millennium trilogy (2005-2007), which has morphed into an ongoing franchise with film adaptations and bestselling continuation novels. With global sales in excess of 100 million across all formats, this series ranks among the biggest megasellers of our time (Steiner 2014; Berglund 2017, 2022). The Millennium books, however, are not an isolated event. They form part of a wave of hundreds of books by Nordic crime writers which have experienced success beyond their country of origin. As such, the Nordic Noir boom is likely the biggest global publishing phenomenon originating outside the English language – far outstripping, for example, the Latin American literary fiction boom of the 1960s and 1970s. Nordic Noir is a prime manifestation of crime fiction as a literary genre that is not only based on transnational exchanges, but also circulates internationally at scale and with comparative ease (Gulddal and King 2022).\nDespite its importance, Nordic Noir has not previously been mapped in terms of its circulation as world literature. To address this gap, The Nordic Noir in Translation Database 2000–2020 (NNTD) provides bibliographic information of the translation flows of all crime fiction from the five main Nordic languages during the period of the so-called “Nordic Noir boom”. Nordic Noir was already being translated beyond the Nordic languages prior to the 2000s – notable examples include Sjöwall & Wahlöö’s Martin Beck series (1965-1975), Henning Mankell’s Wallander series (1991-2009) and individual novels such as Peter Høeg’s Frøken Smillas fornemmelse for sne (1992; Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow, 2003). However, it was only at the after the turn of the millennium that it became a mass phenomenon, and that the terms Scandinoir or Nordic Noir gained currency as global brands. The NNTD’s timeframe, 2000-2020, therefore captures the rise of Nordic Noir in the early 2000s and the genre’s peak following the global success of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy (2005-2007) around 2010.\nWhile particularly relevant to crime fiction scholars, the dataset will also be useful for scholars in the fields of world literature, comparative literature, book history, publishing studies, sociology of literature and translation studies. The NNTD provides a unique resource for scholars studying the circulation of world literature in the 21st century, particularly in the context of genre fiction, bestsellers and other kinds of commercially oriented fiction as well as in relation to the structures and agents of the book trade. Since it charts translation flows from (semi-)peripheral languages, it offers useful data for scholars working comparatively with a focus on such language areas.\nSpecific (hypothetical) user profiles include:\n\nCrime fiction scholars interested in mapping and comparing international dissemination patterns as well as the overall extent of crime fiction circulating in translation. In particular, the data enables studies of the timeline, scope, reach and impact of the Nordic Noir phenomenon.\nPublishing studies scholars focusing on the international circulation of contemporary genre fiction as well as on bestsellers, international rights sales and industry drivers of global success.\nComparative literature scholars working on global literary translation flows and their impact in the form of reception and formal/stylistic influence.\nTranslation studies scholars interested in contemporary trends and translation flows on a macro scale.\n\nIn parallel with this this dataset, we have published a research article in Translation Studies (Berglund, Gulddal and King). In this article, we discuss some key findings related to the NNTD, including the exceptional volume of translations, the growth rates over the studied period, the Swedish dominance, and the impact of certain bestselling authors. At the time of writing, the data has not been used by anyone else. No other similar or overlapping datasets are available, publicly or otherwise."

    "text": "Collection and Creation\nSeparate data sources and data collection methods have been used for each language. The data for Danish crime fiction was extracted from 1) the “Translators Database”, a bibliographic resource maintained by the Danish Arts Foundation (DAF) and covering translations of Danish literature across all genres, and 2) a dataset of international rights sales by Danish publishers and agents in the period 2010-2020, also acquired from the DAF. For Finnish crime fiction data was drawn from “Finnish literature in translation”, a database compiled by the Finnish Literature Exchange (FILI) listing all book-length volumes of Finnish, Finland Swedish and Sami literature in translation. The data for Icelandic crime fiction was provided by the National and University Library of Iceland (NULI), which has a long-standing policy of purchasing print copies of all translations of Icelandic books and hence has virtually complete records of translated crime fiction. The bibliographic data for Norwegian crime fiction was compiled using the Norwegian national bibliography – “Nasjonalbibliografien” – as it appears in the digital database Oria which, in theory, includes all Norwegian literature in translation. The bibliographic data for Swedish crime fiction in translation was based on LIBRIS, the catalogue of all Swedish academic and research libraries. For details, see the Bibliography and the methods and material discussion in the research article (Berglund, Gulddal and King).\nThe definition of crime fiction has been operationalised differently across the five languages in line with what was practically achievable. For Norwegian and Swedish, the points of departure are comprehensive crime fiction bibliographies compiled by genre experts. Covering almost all crime fiction published in their respective countries, these bibliographies use an “inclusive” genre definition that encompasses all sub-genres: whodunnits, hardboiled, detective fiction, spy fiction, thrillers, psychological suspense novels, genre hybrids, etc. For Danish, Finnish and Icelandic, genre categorisation is based on library and book-trade classifications available in the collected data. Yet, even though the agents are different, they base their classifications on similar definitions of crime fiction. The broad definition of crime fiction as fiction ‘focusing on crime’, which is favoured by crime fiction bibliographers as well as by most crime fiction scholars, is close to the “umbrella genre” of crime and suspense used in both contemporary book publishing and in libraries (cf. Berglund 2021). All sources used for defining crime fiction are listed in the Bibliography.\nThe data aggregated from these resources has been manually curated by the authors of the dataset, but this curation only involves aspects such as harmonisation, syntax, and spelling. In practice, this means that we have corrected misspelled name variations and harmonised syntax in the author column (e.g. changed “Camilla Lackberg” and “Läckberg, Camilla” to “Camilla Läckberg”); harmonised original titles and deleted occasional genre indicators (e.g. changed “Sorgenfri: En Harry Hole-thriller” to “Sorgenfri”) in the source_title column; and harmonised language names and corrected misspellings in the target language column (e.g. changed “Slovakian” and “slovak” to “Slovak”). For languages, we have followed the names given in the ISO language code list."

    "text": "Description\nThe dataset contains information organized by seven variables:\nauthor ⇒ The author of the translated book.\noriginal_title ⇒ The title of the translated book in its original source language.\noriginal_language ⇒ The source language of the translated book.\noriginal_publication_year ⇒ The year of first publication in the source language.\ntranslated_title ⇒ The main title of the translated book.\ntranslated_language ⇒ The target language of the translated book. In the few cases (10 in total)  where the translated title was not available in the bibliographic sources used and where we were unable to retrieve it in other ways, we have either provided the name of the original title or identified the language of the title, i.e. “[chinese title]”.1\ntranslated_publication_year ⇒ The year the book was published in translation.\nThe NNTD comprises bibliographic records of – in theory – all translations of Nordic crime fiction for adults, written in any of the five main Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish) and published in translation during the period 2000–2020. The dataset is delimited to include only first edition translations published in print book form. We have included the “in theory” qualification because we acknowledge that quantitative investigations of bibliographic data involve statistical loss, and that this general problem is exacerbated in the translation context because compilers of national bibliographies tend not to prioritise outbound translations. Accordingly, we concur with previous scholarship on global translation patterns (Heilbron 1999; Lindqvist 2016) that exact numbers are impossible to produce, and that any dataset related to global translation flows – including the NNTD – should be understood as evidence-based indications of tendencies. The international sources available for studying translation, such as the Index Translationum (IT), unfortunately suffer from severe methodological problems and have large gaps (Heilbron 2000; Svedjedal 2012). Because the NNTD draws only on bibliographic information at the national level, which is generally much more reliable than the IT, we are confident that it is as complete as can be achieved. For further discussion, see our research article based on this dataset (Berglund, Gulddal and King).\nThe dataset is available in a matrix format as one csv file, consisting of 8,886 rows (one row per translation event) and seven columns. The columns cover the key parameters: author(s); original title; original year of publication; source language; title in translation; target language; and year published in translation. The dataset thus covers 8,886 translation events of Nordic crime fiction during the period 2000-2020, distributed over 408 unique authors and author constellations, and 1,588 unique translated titles. Further descriptive statistics concerning the composition of the dataset can be found in the associated research article. These parameters are with very few exceptions complete for all rows in the dataset. All information has been checked manually against national biographical databases. The only exception is the column “title” (in translation), where such checking was not always possible for practical reasons.\nIt would have been valuable to include other parameters in the dataset, including original publisher; publisher of the translation; and translator(s). However, the nature of our sources made it impossible to collect this data in a structured and systematic way."

    "text": "Significance and Context\nThese datasets provide valuable metadata for researchers of 20th century American literature working in fields such as cultural analytics, book and publishing history, and the sociology of literature. In cultural analytics, recent scholarship has used bestseller status as a rough proxy for popularity, enabling researchers to computationally model the textual boundaries between, for instance, popular and prizewinning fiction (Algee-Hewitt and McGurl 2015; Piper et al. 2016b; English 2016). Previous research of this kind has often relied on the Publishers Weekly annual bestseller list. Although Publishers Weekly also publishes a weekly list, it is not readily accessible to researchers. In contrast to the Publishers Weekly annual list, this dataset reports weekly bestsellers, and therefore captures a much broader subset of the historical literary marketplace.\nThis larger and more granular New York Times dataset presents researchers with a number of potential uses. First of all, existing experiments on bestsellers and prizewinners could be reproduced with this new data. The broader scope of this dataset is likely to dampen the apparent difference between prizewinners and bestsellers, as many prizewinners made it onto the Times list without making it onto that of Publisher’s Weekly. Second, the broader scope of the Times list provides a valuable resource for constructing corpora of historical popular literature. Weekly bestsellers have been neglected in humanities corpora relative to yearly bestsellers. Finally, the Times list could be used to support ongoing research at the intersection of literary and publishing history. As the most closely-followed public-facing bestseller list, the Times list offers insight into the works considered valuable by publishers."

Two works were then considered a match if surnames were exact matches and the Times title field overlapped at the beginning of the HathiTrust shorttitle field. This yielded 4,978 matches.

    "text": "Juliana Spahr and Stephanie Young—joined in co-authorship, later, by Claire Grossman—were poets who began to notice something: “at most of the readings we attend, the room is mainly white.” This observation bothered them. They gathered anecdotes. They queried friends. When they heard about rooms that were other-than-white, they sought them out “only to find that they no longer existed or barely existed.” Something was wrong with poetry, so they set out to learn more. Early in their research they realized that if they wanted to know the truth about whiteness and US poetry they would need more than anecdotes. They would need data: lots of data.\nThey thought that creative writing programs might be less white, but they were wrong. They thought that prizewinners might be less white, and found that, though prizes were more racially equitable in the twenty-first century, the winners shared elite educational backgrounds. They thought that technology—desktop publishing, the internet—might have democratized publishing, but they learned that racism, Ivy League degrees, and elite creative writing programs maintain gross inequality in poetry.\nGrossman, Spahr, and Young aren’t alone in recognizing two facts: contemporary literature is vast; and awash in data. While they surveyed rooms and rosters, literary scholars across the US had also quietly begun gathering data to document the complex, interlocking system of literary prejudice and prestige. Conspicuous blurbs create networks that subtly organize the field into coteries. Online social media platforms have resurrected and repurposed authorship. One scholar collected Publishers Weekly bestseller lists for fiction between 1950 and 2000 and discovered that 98% of the titles were written by white authors. Meanwhile, a graduate student at the University of Chicago gathered The New York Times’ bestseller lists for his dissertation. And a professor at the University of New Orleans, wanting to address the silence of African American literature on these lists, assembled Essence’s bestseller lists that captured hugely popular books like Omar Tyree’s Flyy Girl and Sister Souljah’s The Coldest Winter Ever that the mainstream lists failed to register.\nIncreased scholarly attention to data is the complement to a changing literary culture. “The personal computer, mobile devices, the cloud, the server farm, the search engine, the algorithm, and the network are now indispensable parts of daily life,” write Jessica Pressman and Aarthi Vadde. “They are equally indispensable to the reading, writing, and distribution of literature.” Thanks to ebooks and the ease of self-publishing, the number of fiction titles published in the US each year increased, between 1990 and 2010, by a factor of ten, from around 5000 to more than 50,000. Since 2013, that number has risen above 70,000. Among this vastness, new genres proliferate like mushrooms after a rain, none more “quintessential,” argues Mark McGurl, than Adult Baby Diaper Erotica. The participatory culture of web 2.0 has lent itself to immense collections of fan fiction at fanfiction.net and on Wattpad. More and more people listen to audiobooks. The performance of authorship in the digital literary sphere is defined against participatory culture, whether one is an enthusiastic participant, like Margaret Atwood, or a curmudgeonly holdout, like Jonathan Franzen—or a curmudgeonly participant, describing works of autofiction as “wan little husks.” Increasingly, publishers look for large social media follower counts from prospective authors who, in turn, often live Very Online. Sales can be driven by tears on TikTok.\nAt this point, data is the foundation of contemporary literary culture. Prominent novelists such as Teju Cole, Joshua Cohen, and Jennifer Egan have, for some years, been provoking us—through Twitter fiction, livestreaming the writing of a novel, and incorporating PowerPoint into a novel—to update our accounts of literature’s material culture in the digital age. We ought to recognize data’s function in much the way book historians have long recognized the role of print technology in production, circulation, and reception: from the printing press to offset printing to the mimeograph to desktop publishing. Adobe’s Portable Document Format was to the 1990s what wood pulp was to the 1860s. The work is ongoing. Scholars have written literary histories of word processing and the digital literary sphere, not to mention critiques of the exorbitant energy and military histories of the infrastructure that stores this voluminous data. But what about the data itself?\nThe data is voluminous, and the process of collecting it has only begun. Not long ago, we noticed that data collection in literary studies was happenstance. Some scholars in California wanted to investigate the whiteness of poetry, so they started filling spreadsheets. Some scholars in Iowa wanted to understand the influence of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, so they started filling spreadsheets. One of us began filling spreadsheets with information about literary agents. One of us began filling spreadsheets with lists from publishing imprints. But we were figuring out how to do it as we went, more or less separately. We lacked criteria for what good data collection looked like. We knew we wanted to share our data eventually, but we didn’t know how best to do so. And we knew that this data, collected by these scholars, would be much more powerful together than separate.\nWe—Laura and Dan—decided to form a collective to address the challenges that we and our colleagues were beginning to face. We formed an editorial board. We partnered with the journal Post45 and the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. We launched the Post45 Data Collective in April 2021.\nThe Post45 Data Collective peer reviews and houses post-1945 literary data on our open-access website, for use, reuse, research, and teaching. Copyright prevents us from hosting literature itself, so we include, whenever possible, IDs that allow users to access texts in the HathiTrust digital library and study them through the HathiTrust Research Center. The Data Collective hosts, as of today: a series of datasets that describe who attended the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, their advisor, and the title of their thesis, among other metadata. Building a dataset is difficult work that ought to be cited and recognized by institutions; to make that easier, we send datasets through double-blind peer review and, upon acceptance, issue them a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI, to enable citation. Several further datasets stand in the queue. These include weekly bestseller lists for fiction from The New York Times, black bestseller lists from Essence, and the data about poetry and prizes that undergirded the landmark scholarship by Claire Grossman, Juliana Spahr, and Stephanie Young.\nImagine what will be possible. One day soon we will be able to map the network of the literary field. We will be able to trace connections between literary agents, blurbs, editors, imprints, and Goodreads reviews to prizes and institutions of higher ed. We will be able to investigate tax documents from conglomerates to understand how they manage publishers and film studios. We will be able to study the influence of these networks and this management—for better and, certainly, for worse—on literature itself. This is a beginning. It’s time."
