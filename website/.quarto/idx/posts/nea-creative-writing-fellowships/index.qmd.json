In the years since then, the NEA has awarded more than 3700 Creative Writing Fellowships to fund writers in the United States.\n\n# Collection and Creation\n\nThe list of fellows was web-scraped from publicly accessible [NEA records](https://www.arts.gov/grants/recent-grants/literature-fellowships), and then cross-referenced (for accuracy) with [“NEA Literature Fellowships: 40 Years of Supporting American Writers,”](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA_lit.pdf) which also includes geographic information about the writers sponsored from 1966 to 2006. Additional demographic and educational information was then gathered by the research team using a range of sources, including author biographies and websites, institutional websites, interviews, encyclopedias, literary criticism, and literary journalism.\n\nAlong with information on each writer’s education, the research team worked to gather information on how they identify in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity. As @so2020 writes in *Redlining Culture: A Data History of Racial Inequality and Postwar Fiction*, “traditional statistical methods have often historically meant the quantification of one’s objects of study and the reification of race. Such labeling works against the aims of critical race studies, which takes as its very mission the deconstruction of racial categories.” While this project’s research team is committed to constructivist theories of racialization, we are also committed to documenting forms of inequality in the literary field. Given that the NEA fellowships are federally funded, the fact that only 15 percent of all grantees between 1966 and 2024 identify as Black, Asian American, Latinx, or Indigenous is significant and troubling. The inclusion of information about race and ethnicity in this dataset is intended to help identify such inequities.\n\nEach writer was researched by no fewer than two members of the research team, each working independently. When discrepancies arose between the findings of the initial researchers, an additional member (or members) of the research team worked to reconcile the data by corroborating the existing research notes with additional sources. Nevertheless, there were writers for whom some information was not possible to ascertain. The hope is that this dataset will continue to be improved by future researchers. To that end, please report any errors, corrections, or additions (including relevant citations) to Alexander Manshel ([alexander.manshel\\@mcgill.ca](mailto:alexander.manshel@mcgill.ca)). The dataset will be updated regularly with any necessary amendments.\n\n# Funding\n\nThis dataset was made possible by generous grants from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC), and the Post45 Data Collective.\n\n# Description\n\n-   **full_name_lastfirst**: full name as listed in NEA records;

Nevertheless, information about any individual writer’s year of birth, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or education is sensitive. This data is provided here only to enable the study of broad patterns throughout the history of the NEA Creative Writing Fellowships and not intended as definitive. Requests to correct, amend, or remove any such sensitive information will be honored. Please contact Alexander Manshel ([alexander.manshel\\@mcgill.ca](mailto:alexander.manshel@mcgill.ca)) with any questions or concerns.\n\nMore than 240 NEA fellowships have been awarded to writers who have publicly identified themselves as “white” or “a white writer,” and are listed here as such. That said, nearly 2900 fellowships (over 78 percent of all fellowships in the dataset) are listed as “uniden,” or *unidentifying*, in the field corresponding to race and ethnicity. Many of these writers likely identified or identify as white, but the research team was nevertheless unable to find a source to corroborate that active identification. This is unsurprising given how whiteness often goes unmarked. As @morrison1993 writes in *Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination* about one of Ernest Hemingway’s characters, “we know \\[he\\] is white, and we know he is because nobody says so.” Despite this, writers in this dataset are listed alternatively as “white” or “uniden” in order to avoid presuming or projecting whiteness onto individual writers. Given that many writers refer to themselves as “Irish American” or “German American,” for example, without explicitly identifying as white, the dataset lists them here as “uniden / irisham” or “uniden / germanam.”\n\nThe 94 unique values for the field of “race_ethnicity” include: “afam” (African American); “arabam” (Arab American); “asianam” (Asian American); “black / caribam” (Black or Caribbean American); “indigenous,” “latinx,” “mixedrace,” “uniden,” “uniden / jewish,” “white,” “white / jewish.” In the case that writers identify in multiple ways, those multiple identifications are listed here separated by slashes: e.g., “asianam / southasian,” “indigenous / latinx,” “uniden / germanam / jewish.”\n\n# References\n::: {#refs}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n**Principal Investigator**: Alexander Manshel\\\n**Research Assistants**: Alexandra Colby, Nived Dharmaraj, Emaline Gonzalez Thomas, Xujia Guan, Adam Hill, Nicole Huang, Richard Joseph, Matthew Molinaro, Jordan Pruett, Jaede Shillingford\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts_%28NEA%29_Logo_2018_Square_on_Black.svg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\nThis dataset contains a comprehensive list of the writers sponsored by National Endowment for the Arts fellowships from the organization’s founding in 1965 to 2024, including information about those writers’ demographics, education, and geography.\n\n# Data Table\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Load the function\nsource(\"../../scripts/createDataTable.R\")\n\ndata_path = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/data/refs/heads/main/Post45_NEAData_Final.csv\"\n\ncreateDataTable(\n  data_path = data_path,\n\n     style = \"bootstrap\",  # Bootstrap DataTables style\n  bootstrap_classes = \"table-condensed\",  # Add extra classes\n\n   displayed_columns = c(\"nea_grant_year\", \"full_name_firstlast\", \"given_name_middle\",\"family_name\", \"gender\",\"race_ethnicity\", \"birth_year\",\"country\",\"us_state\",\"hometown\",\"ba\",\"ba2\",\"ma\",\"ma2\",\"phd\",\"mfa\",\"mfa2\",\"post45_hathi_entry\",  \"nea_person_id\"),\n\n    column_widths = c(\"gender\" = \"100px\", \"race\" = \"100px\", \"country\" = \"100px\", \"author\" = \"100px\"),\n\n    # date_columns = c(\"week\"),\n\n  # currency_columns = c(\"prize_amount\"),\n\n   category_columns = c(\"gender\", \"race_ethnicity\", \"country\", \"us_state\"),\n\n   sort_columns = c(\"nea_grant_year\"),\n   sort_orders = c(\"desc\"),\n\n  \n)\n\n# Print out column names to make it easier to customize above\n# df <- read.csv(data_path)\n# cat(paste(shQuote(colnames(df), type = \"cmd\"), collapse = \", \"))\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## Creative Commons License\n\n<p xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\">\n\nThis work is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\" style=\"display:inline-block;\">CC BY 4.0<img src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1\" style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\"/><img src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1\" style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\"/></a>\n\n</p>\n:::\n\n# Data Visualization and Exploration\n\n```{ojs}\n//|echo: false\n//|output: false\n// https://observablehq.com/d/75d37bad8cc92862\nimport {viewof groupByColumn, viewof topX, fetchData, viewof neaGrantYearRange, filtered_data, line_chart, bar_chart} from \"75d37bad8cc92862\"\n```\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//|echo: false\n//|output: false\ntable_data = fetchData(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/data/refs/heads/main/Post45_NEAData_Final.csv\"\n)\n\n\n// Select specific columns\nfiltered_data = table_data.map(d => ({\n  full_name_firstlast: d.full_name_firstlast,\n  given_name_middle: d.given_name_middle,\n  family_name: d.family_name,\n  gender: d.gender,\n  race_ethnicity: d.race_ethnicity,\n  //birth_year: d.birth_year,\n  country: d.country,\n  us_state: d.us_state,\n  hometown: d.hometown,\n  ba: d.ba,\n  //ba2: d.ba2,\n  ma: d.ma,\n  ma2: d.ma2,\n  phd: d.phd,\n  mfa: d.mfa,\n  //mfa2: d.mfa2\n}));\n```\n\n## Explore NEA Fellowships by Category\n```{ojs}\n//|echo: false\nviewof groupByColumn\nviewof topX\nbar_chart\n```\n\n## Explore NEA Fellowships by Year\n```{ojs}\n//|echo: false\nline_chart\nviewof neaGrantYearRange\n```\n\n# Significance and Context\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has been the main channel for the public sponsorship of American writers since its formation in 1965.
