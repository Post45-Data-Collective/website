Thesis and Graduation Records\n\nThe second dataset includes thesis and matriculation records for Iowa graduates between 1931 and Spring 2014, including graduate name, advisor name, year of matriculation, program, degree, thesis title, and literary genre.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Load the function\nsource(\"../../scripts/createDataTable.R\")\n\ndata_path = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/website/refs/heads/main/datasets/iowa_writers_workshop/iowa_writers_workshop-graduations.csv\"\n\ncreateDataTable(\n  data_path = data_path,\n\n displayed_columns = c(\"year\", \"graduate_name\", \"advisor_name\", \"genre\", \"thesis_title\", \"degree\",  \"program\", \"institution\", \"record_id\", \"graduate_id\",  \"advisor_id\",  \"author_authorized_heading\", \"author_lccn\", \"author_viaf\", \"author_wikidata\"),\n\n  # currency_columns = c(\"prize_amount\"),\n\n  category_columns = c(\"genre\", \"program\", \"institution\", \"degree\"),\n\n   column_widths = c(\"thesis_title\" = \"100px\", \"year\" = \"75px\", \"genre\" = \"90px\", \"program\" = \"100px\", \"institution\" = \"100px\"),\n\n\n  # sort_columns = c(\"prize_year\"),\n  # sort_orders = c(\"desc\")\n)\n\n# df <- read.csv(data_path)\n\n# cat(paste(shQuote(colnames(df), type = \"cmd\"), collapse = \", \"))\n```\n\n## Collection and Creation\n\nThese data were initially derived from University of Iowa Library catalog records of MFA theses. Additional data (primarily genre and advisor) were filled in by checking bound copies of theses held in the University Archives. Also included are a small number (\\~1.5% of total) of BA records from other institutions for early faculty and additional degrees earned at Iowa by IWW grads and faculty (e.g., several IWW graduates also have Nonfiction Writing Program MFAs).\n\n## Description\n\n-   **record_id**: numeric id of the graduation record in the Program Era database\n\n-   **graduate_name**: full name of the graduating student\n\n-   **graduate_id**: foreign key referring to person_id of the graduating student in people.csv\n\n-    **institution**: name of degree-granting institution\n\n-    **advisor_name**: full name of the student’s thesis advisor\n\n-    **advisor_id**: foreign key referring to person_id of the thesis advisor in people.csv\n\n-    **year**: year of matriculation (range 1920-2014)\n\n-    **program**: program (e.g. Writers’ Workshop) or major when no specific program applies (e.g. English)\n\n-   **degree:** e.g. “MFA”\n\n-    **thesis_title**: Title of thesis where applicable\n\n-    **genre**: literary genre of the thesis, e.g. “Poetry”, “Fiction”, “Literary Translation”\n\nThis dataset also includes various persistent identifiers:\n\n-   **author_lccn** – Author’s LCCN from id.loc.gov\n-   **author_viaf** – Author viaf.org cluster number\n-   **author_wikidata** – Author’s Wikdiata Q number\n-   **author_authorized_heading**– Author's authorized Name Authority Cooperative (NACO) heading\n\n# 3. Books — HathiTrust Metadata\n\nThe third dataset includes works by notable Iowa Writers’ Workshop authors that are held by the HathiTrust Digital Library, as well as HathiTrust IDs for each title.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Load the function\nsource(\"../../scripts/createDataTable.R\")\n\ndata_path = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/website/refs/heads/main/datasets/iowa_writers_workshop/iowa_writers_workshop-hathitrust_metadata.csv\"\n\ncreateDataTable(\n  data_path = data_path,\n\n   displayed_columns = c(\"author1\", \"author1_normalized\", \"title\", \"date\", \"htid\", \"hathi_rights\", \"oclc_holdings\",  \"oclc_eholdings\", \"place\", \"publisher_marc\",\"imprint\", \"isbn\", \"isbn_most_common_edition\", \"lccn\", \"oclc\", \"oclc_owi\", \"person_id\",\n   \"id\",  \"author2\", \"author3\", \"author4\", \"author_authorized_heading\", \"author_lccn\", \"author_viaf\", \"author_wikidata_qid\"     \n),\n\n column_widths = c(\"title\" = \"100px\", \"date\" = \"75px\"),\n\n  # currency_columns = c(\"prize_amount\"),\n\n  category_columns = c(\"hathi_rights\"),\n\n  # sort_columns = c(\"prize_year\"),\n  # sort_orders = c(\"desc\")\n)\n\n# df <- read.csv(data_path)\n\n# cat(paste(shQuote(colnames(df), type = \"cmd\"), collapse = \", \"))\n```\n\n## Collection and Creation\n\nIn addition to the biographical and institutional data described above, we have provided a collection of metadata and publication data connected to a corpus of volumes written by authors affiliated with the IWW. This corpus, provided by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), is comprised of 1228 volumes with 240 unique individuals listed as main authors. Because we knew it would be impossible to assemble a comprehensive corpus of every author in our institutional dataset and because we knew that many authors who attended the IWW never published work, when building our corpus in collaboration with HTRC we used two selection criteria. First, we searched HTRC’s collections for works by any author listed as director of a IWW graduate’s thesis. Secondly, given that we intend our database to drive a public-facing web service, we searched for authors from Wikipedia’s “List of Iowa Writers’ Workshop people,” as this list constituted an example of an externally and publicly defined list of notable IWW authors. We also felt these criteria would maximize our success rate at finding published works for our author list.\n\nThe volume publication data and metadata provided follow the model established by Ted Underwood’s dataset submitted to the Post45 Collective. Along with author and title information, we have listed each volume’s publisher as well as publication date and location (from MARC metadata). We have also provided Library of Congress and OCLC catalog information for the volumes.\n\n## Description\n\n-    **hathi_id**: HathiTrust item identifier number\n\n- **hathi_rights** - the rights code from Hathi Trust\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## All HathiTrust Rights Codes\n\nHathiTrust Rights Codes ([Source](https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/preservation/rights-database/))\n\n| id  | name           | type      | dscr                                                                                  |\n|-----|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1   | pd             | copyright | public domain                                                                         |\n| 2   | ic             | copyright | in-copyright                                                                           |\n| 3   | op             | copyright | out-of-print (implies in-copyright)                                                    |\n| 4   | orph           | copyright | copyright-orphaned (implies copyright)                                                 |\n| 5   | und            | copyright | undetermined copyright status                                                         |\n| 6   | umall          | access    | available to UM affiliates and walk-in patrons (all campuses)                          |\n| 7   | ic-world       | access    | in-copyright and permitted as world viewable by the copyright holder                   |\n| 8   | nobody         | access    | available to nobody;

Thesis and Graduation Records\n\nThe second dataset includes thesis and matriculation records for Iowa graduates between 1931 and Spring 2014, including graduate name, advisor name, year of matriculation, program, degree, thesis title, and literary genre.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Load the function\nsource(\"../../scripts/createDataTable.R\")\n\ndata_path = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/website/refs/heads/main/datasets/iowa_writers_workshop/iowa_writers_workshop-graduations.csv\"\n\ncreateDataTable(\n  data_path = data_path,\n\n displayed_columns = c(\"year\", \"graduate_name\", \"advisor_name\", \"genre\", \"thesis_title\", \"degree\",  \"program\", \"institution\", \"record_id\", \"graduate_id\",  \"advisor_id\",  \"author_authorized_heading\", \"author_lccn\", \"author_viaf\", \"author_wikidata\"),\n\n  # currency_columns = c(\"prize_amount\"),\n\n  category_columns = c(\"genre\", \"program\", \"institution\", \"degree\"),\n\n   column_widths = c(\"thesis_title\" = \"100px\", \"year\" = \"75px\", \"genre\" = \"90px\", \"program\" = \"100px\", \"institution\" = \"100px\"),\n\n\n  # sort_columns = c(\"prize_year\"),\n  # sort_orders = c(\"desc\")\n)\n\n# df <- read.csv(data_path)\n\n# cat(paste(shQuote(colnames(df), type = \"cmd\"), collapse = \", \"))\n```\n\n## Collection and Creation\n\nThese data were initially derived from University of Iowa Library catalog records of MFA theses. Additional data (primarily genre and advisor) were filled in by checking bound copies of theses held in the University Archives. Also included are a small number (\\~1.5% of total) of BA records from other institutions for early faculty and additional degrees earned at Iowa by IWW grads and faculty (e.g., several IWW graduates also have Nonfiction Writing Program MFAs).\n\n## Description\n\n-   **record_id**: numeric id of the graduation record in the Program Era database\n\n-   **graduate_name**: full name of the graduating student\n\n-   **graduate_id**: foreign key referring to person_id of the graduating student in people.csv\n\n-    **institution**: name of degree-granting institution\n\n-    **advisor_name**: full name of the student’s thesis advisor\n\n-    **advisor_id**: foreign key referring to person_id of the thesis advisor in people.csv\n\n-    **year**: year of matriculation (range 1920-2014)\n\n-    **program**: program (e.g. Writers’ Workshop) or major when no specific program applies (e.g. English)\n\n-   **degree:** e.g. “MFA”\n\n-    **thesis_title**: Title of thesis where applicable\n\n-    **genre**: literary genre of the thesis, e.g. “Poetry”, “Fiction”, “Literary Translation”\n\nThis dataset also includes various persistent identifiers:\n\n-   **author_lccn** – Author’s LCCN from id.loc.gov\n-   **author_viaf** – Author viaf.org cluster number\n-   **author_wikidata** – Author’s Wikdiata Q number\n-   **author_authorized_heading**– Author's authorized Name Authority Cooperative (NACO) heading\n\n# 3. Books — HathiTrust Metadata\n\nThe third dataset includes works by notable Iowa Writers’ Workshop authors that are held by the HathiTrust Digital Library, as well as HathiTrust IDs for each title.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Load the function\nsource(\"../../scripts/createDataTable.R\")\n\ndata_path = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Post45-Data-Collective/website/refs/heads/main/datasets/iowa_writers_workshop/iowa_writers_workshop-hathitrust_metadata.csv\"\n\ncreateDataTable(\n  data_path = data_path,\n\n   displayed_columns = c(\"author1\", \"author1_normalized\", \"title\", \"date\", \"htid\", \"hathi_rights\", \"oclc_holdings\",  \"oclc_eholdings\", \"place\", \"publisher_marc\",\"imprint\", \"isbn\", \"isbn_most_common_edition\", \"lccn\", \"oclc\", \"oclc_owi\", \"person_id\",\n   \"id\",  \"author2\", \"author3\", \"author4\", \"author_authorized_heading\", \"author_lccn\", \"author_viaf\", \"author_wikidata_qid\"     \n),\n\n column_widths = c(\"title\" = \"100px\", \"date\" = \"75px\"),\n\n  # currency_columns = c(\"prize_amount\"),\n\n  category_columns = c(\"hathi_rights\"),\n\n  # sort_columns = c(\"prize_year\"),\n  # sort_orders = c(\"desc\")\n)\n\n# df <- read.csv(data_path)\n\n# cat(paste(shQuote(colnames(df), type = \"cmd\"), collapse = \", \"))\n```\n\n## Collection and Creation\n\nIn addition to the biographical and institutional data described above, we have provided a collection of metadata and publication data connected to a corpus of volumes written by authors affiliated with the IWW. This corpus, provided by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), is comprised of 1228 volumes with 240 unique individuals listed as main authors. Because we knew it would be impossible to assemble a comprehensive corpus of every author in our institutional dataset and because we knew that many authors who attended the IWW never published work, when building our corpus in collaboration with HTRC we used two selection criteria. First, we searched HTRC’s collections for works by any author listed as director of a IWW graduate’s thesis. Secondly, given that we intend our database to drive a public-facing web service, we searched for authors from Wikipedia’s “List of Iowa Writers’ Workshop people,” as this list constituted an example of an externally and publicly defined list of notable IWW authors. We also felt these criteria would maximize our success rate at finding published works for our author list.\n\nThe volume publication data and metadata provided follow the model established by Ted Underwood’s dataset submitted to the Post45 Collective. Along with author and title information, we have listed each volume’s publisher as well as publication date and location (from MARC metadata). We have also provided Library of Congress and OCLC catalog information for the volumes.\n\n## Description\n\n-    **hathi_id**: HathiTrust item identifier number\n\n- **hathi_rights** - the rights code from Hathi Trust\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## All HathiTrust Rights Codes\n\nHathiTrust Rights Codes ([Source](https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/preservation/rights-database/))\n\n| id  | name           | type      | dscr                                                                                  |\n|-----|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1   | pd             | copyright | public domain                                                                         |\n| 2   | ic             | copyright | in-copyright                                                                           |\n| 3   | op             | copyright | out-of-print (implies in-copyright)                                                    |\n| 4   | orph           | copyright | copyright-orphaned (implies copyright)                                                 |\n| 5   | und            | copyright | undetermined copyright status                                                         |\n| 6   | umall          | access    | available to UM affiliates and walk-in patrons (all campuses)                          |\n| 7   | ic-world       | access    | in-copyright and permitted as world viewable by the copyright holder                   |\n| 8   | nobody         | access    | available to nobody;

Other than gender, we have not tagged any of our entries with demographic data that might be considered sensitive or subjective.\n\nThe gender information for authors in this data was collected by researching biographical information available on authors included in our database. When no biographical information on an author was available, the PEP team attempted to infer (when possible) the author’s most likely gender based on name. While there are instances where an individual author’s gender identity information may not be discernable, our data does allow for a reliable aggregate examination of gender trends in the IWW over time."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":["ipynb","pdf","docx"]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
