Please submit your essay as a Google Doc or a Word document. We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create our website, so if you are familiar with Quarto, you can also create your essay with our [.qmd template](https://github.com/Post45-Data-Collective/website/blob/main/data_essay_template.qmd).\n\nWhen you’re ready, email your dataset and data essay to Melanie Walsh (melwalsh@uw.edu), Alexander Manshel (alexander.manshel@mcgill.ca), and J.D. Porter (porterjd@sas.upenn.edu).\n\n\nData essays should include the following sections and answer most, if not all, of the following questions. \n\nSignificance and Context \n-------------------------\n\n*   How is the data significant for the field of literary studies and cultural studies, especially post-1945 scholarship?\n*   What is the social and historical context of the data? What background information or domain knowledge is necessary to use this data responsibly? (Please note that Post45 Data Collective datasets are often used by people who do not specialize in post-1945 scholarship.)\n*   Who might the data be useful for? What could the data be used for? Please suggest at least three specific uses.\n*   For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a gap that needed to be filled? Has the data been used already? Does similar or overlapping data exist publicly? If so, please describe.\n\nCollection + Creation\n---------------------\n\n*   How and when was the data collected, acquired, or created? What mechanisms or procedures were used to curate it (e.g. human curation, software, API)?\n*   If the data was hand-curated, what organizational heuristic was adopted, and why?\n*   What aspects of the data are products of the researcher’s judgment or interpretation? What judgments, interpretations, or decisions have been inherited by the researcher(s), if any? What are the implications of these interpretations or decisions?\n*   Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g. students, crowdworkers, contractors), and how were they compensated?\n*   Was any cleaning of the data undertaken (e.g. removal of instances, processing of missing values)?\n\nProvide sufficient detail such that readers understand how the dataset was created, and would within reason be able to recreate it.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n*   What does the data describe? Are all instances included or a selection? If selected, what principles were used to justify inclusions and exclusions?\n*   If your dataset uses categorical variables or other labels or fields that you have created, explain how they were constructed. Should the user be aware of any categories or fields that condense or erase information?\n*   Is any information missing? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g. because it was unavailable). Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies? If so, please describe.\n\nEthical Considerations\n----------------------\n\n*   What possible negative impacts or harms might result from the publication of your data? How could the data be misused?\n*   Does the dataset contain information that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please describe.\n*   Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive (e.g. data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please describe.\n*   Were any ethical review processes undertaken in the collection or curation of this dataset (e.g. the consultation of an institutional review board)? If so, please describe these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link to supporting documentation.\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\n*   Will the data be updated (e.g. to correct errors, add new instances, delete instances)? If so, please describe how often and by whom.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n*   Please provide a list of sources that reference or draw on this data, or that were used or consulted to produce the data. If there are other sources that would help users understand this data, please include them, as well.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\n*   What is the license for this data? If applicable, the data must be deposited under an open license that permits unrestricted access (e.g. CC0, CC-BY).\n\n\nPreparing + Formatting Your Data\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Post45 Data Collective aims to maximize the reusability and interoperability of our datasets.
