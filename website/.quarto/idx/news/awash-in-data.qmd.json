They gathered anecdotes. They queried friends. When they heard about rooms that were other-than-white, they sought them out “only to find that they no longer existed or barely existed.” Something was wrong with poetry, so they set out to learn more. Early in their research they realized that if they wanted to know the truth about whiteness and US poetry they would need more than anecdotes. They would need data: lots of data.\n\nThey thought that creative writing programs might be less white, but they were [wrong](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-program-era-and-the-mainly-white-room/). They thought that prizewinners might be less white, and [found](http://asapjournal.com/on-poets-and-prizes-juliana-spahr-and-stephanie-young/) that, though prizes were more racially equitable in the twenty-first century, the winners shared elite educational backgrounds.

While they surveyed rooms and rosters, literary scholars across the US had also quietly begun gathering data to document the complex, interlocking system of literary prejudice and prestige.

Meanwhile, a graduate student at the University of Chicago gathered _The New York Times_’ bestseller lists for his dissertation.

The participatory culture of [web 2.0](https://post45.org/2019/09/web-2-0-and-literary-criticism/) has lent itself to immense collections of fan fiction at [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/).

The performance of authorship in the [digital literary sphere](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/digital-literary-sphere) is defined against participatory culture, whether one is an enthusiastic participant, like Margaret Atwood, or a curmudgeonly holdout, like Jonathan Franzen—or a curmudgeonly participant, describing works of autofiction as [“wan little husks.”](https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/1371859718650597387) Increasingly, publishers [look for large social media follower counts](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-talented-ms-calloway/) from prospective authors who, in turn, often live Very Online.

We ought to recognize data’s function in much the way book historians have long recognized the role of print technology in production, circulation, and reception: from the printing press to offset printing to the mimeograph to desktop publishing. Adobe’s Portable Document Format was to the 1990s what wood pulp was to the 1860s. The work is ongoing. Scholars have written literary histories [of word processing](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) and the [digital literary sphere](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/digital-literary-sphere), not to mention critiques of the exorbitant energy and military histories of [the infrastructure](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/prehistory-cloud) that stores this voluminous data. But what about the data itself?\n\nThe data _is_ voluminous, and the process of collecting it has only begun. Not long ago, we noticed that data collection in literary studies was happenstance. Some scholars in California wanted to investigate the whiteness of poetry, so they started filling spreadsheets. Some scholars in Iowa wanted to understand the influence of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, so they started filling spreadsheets. One of us began filling spreadsheets with information about literary agents. One of us began filling spreadsheets with lists from publishing imprints. But we were figuring out how to do it as we went, more or less separately. We lacked criteria for what good data collection looked like. We knew we wanted to share our data eventually, but we didn’t know how best to do so. And we knew that this data, collected by these scholars, would be much more powerful together than separate.\n\nWe—Laura and Dan—decided to form a collective to address the challenges that we and our colleagues were beginning to face. We formed an editorial board. We partnered with the journal Post45 and the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. We launched the Post45 Data Collective in April 2021.\n\nThe Post45 Data Collective peer reviews and houses post-1945 literary data on our [open-access website](https://data.post45.org/our-data/), for use, reuse, research, and teaching. Copyright prevents us from hosting literature itself, so we include, whenever possible, IDs that allow users to access texts in the HathiTrust digital library and study them through the HathiTrust Research Center. The Data Collective hosts, as of today: a series of datasets that describe who attended the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, their advisor, and the title of their thesis, among other metadata. Building a dataset is difficult work that ought to be cited and recognized by institutions; to make that easier, we send datasets through double-blind peer review and, upon acceptance, issue them a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI, to enable citation. Several further datasets stand in the queue. These include weekly bestseller lists for fiction from _The New York Times_, black bestseller lists from _Essence_, and the data about poetry and prizes that undergirded the landmark scholarship by Claire Grossman, Juliana Spahr, and Stephanie Young.\n\nImagine what will be possible. One day soon we will be able to map the network of the literary field. We will be able to trace connections between literary agents, blurbs, editors, imprints, and Goodreads reviews to prizes and institutions of higher ed. We will be able to investigate tax documents from conglomerates to understand how they manage publishers and film studios. We will be able to study the influence of these networks and this management—for better and, certainly, for worse—on literature itself. This is a beginning.
