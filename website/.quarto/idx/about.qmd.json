McGrath began planning and research for the Post45 Data Collective in 2019. They observed that many scholars in the field of post-1945 literature and culture were building datasets and collaborating informally to figure out how to make various interpretive and technical decisions related to the data.

To do so, they performed a literature review, assembled an editorial board (consisting of scholars in literary studies, digital humanities, and library and information science), developed peer review criteria, and established coordination with the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, which agreed to build a website and maintain its data infrastructure.
