*Submit a proposal for the Post45 Data Collective Graduate Wokrshop [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelPcZjKtXzTcab8P9-AymEL-FvtHBWo5VMj9SsW-OjA5yMOg/viewform).*

The Post45 Data Collective invites graduate students in the humanities or adjacent fields to explore cultural data reflexively and collaboratively in a mini-workshop hosted virtually on **Friday, March 13**. 

This one-day workshop will explore the intersections of DH scholarship and DH professionalization, inviting early-career scholars **to think alongside editors from the P45DC (Alexander Manshel, J.D. Porter, and Melanie Walsh), the Nineteenth-Century Data Collective, *Post45 Journal*, and *Public Book*s**. Feedback will focus not only on how to make meaning from data, but also how to situate data-driven humanities scholarship in an ever-changing professional landscape. 

The mini-workshop will consist of ~12 short graduate student presentations (10-15 minutes) that each use one or more of the P45DC datasets.

Presentations themselves should be approached creatively and expansively: some projects might be polished and complete, and others might be in exploratory or in-progress phases. 

Post-presentation discussion will be oriented toward future possibilities of your project, including insight from more senior scholars on topics like peer review, public-facing publication, dissertation writing, or framing for the job market.
